# racism-tracker-northeastindia
An online dashboard of tracking reported incidents of Racism of North East Indian people within the country of India

### Motivation

North East Indian people have been witnessing racism since years from people of other parts of the country.
The amounts of cases of reported events of racism had statiscally increased since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic with a lot of North East Indian students studying in other parts of India being usually mocked as the carriers of the virus by calling them "Corona". There have been an incident when a Manipuri girl in the middle of Delhi was spat on with tobacco by a middle-aged man passing on a scooter calling her "Corona".
The above events are only few of the events that frequently happen. Most do not get reported.
There are thousands of github repositories out there and we are advancing technologically at a very fast and we are working on projects that eases our tasks at hand. It is important for us to ponder, pause and counter our social issues too through technology and if a dashboard or a website provisions that process, it should be welcome.
