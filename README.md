# racism-tracker-northeastindia
A dashboard of tracking reported incidents of Racism of North East Indian people within the country of India

### Motivation

North East Indian people have been witnessing racism since years from people of other parts of the country.
The amounts of cases of reported events of racism had statiscally increased since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic with a lot of North-East Indian students studying in other parts of India being usually mocked as the carriers of the virus by calling them "Corona". There have been an incident when a Manipuri girl in the middle of Delhi was spat on with tobacco by a middle-aged man passing on a scooter calling her "Corona".
There are thousands of github repositories out there and we are advancing technologically at a very fast. It is important for us to ponder, pause and counter our social issues and if a dashboard or a website provisions that process, it should be welcome.

### Note

Volunteers are welcome to contribute to this social project.

### Say No To Racism, Grow As A Society!
